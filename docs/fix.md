# Ubuntu Server ISO Extraction Bug Fix for Cubic

> Cubic (Custom Ubuntu ISO Creator) is a GUI wizard to create a customized Live ISO image for Ubuntu and Debian based distributions.

As of February 27, 2025, the official
[Cubic](https://github.com/PJ-Singh-001/Cubic) tool (version 2024.09) is unable to properly extract and process Ubuntu Server ISOs. It fails with an error message **Error: Unable to extract the compressed Linux file system.**

I created this fix because I needed to create a custom Ubuntu Server ISO for a project and discovered the bug. 

This fix is provided as a temporary solution for those experiencing issues with Ubuntu Server ISO extraction. We will discontinue maintenance of this fix once the bug is fixed in the official Cubic codebase. If you have any questions or issues with this fix, please open an issue.
