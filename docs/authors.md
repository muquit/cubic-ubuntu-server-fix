The fix is developed collaboratively with **Claude AI 3.7 Sonnet**, 
working under my guidance and instructions.   The AI assisted in 
diagnosing the issue, developing multiple solution approaches, and 
refining the code to properly handle Ubuntu Server's two-part squashfs structure.

If you use this fix, please consider submitting it to the Cubic developers 
to help improve the original software.
